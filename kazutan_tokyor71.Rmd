# What I am struggling to use R...

- In my work, I connect to a database and process large data
- When I run my script, **it takes a lot of time** to get results
  - Other scripts can not be executed during execution
  - Work is not going on, it will cause "Zangyou(残業)"
  - Anyway, I'm really bored while waiting!

- Just run a code `tubeplayR::tubeplay("url")`

    - RStudio Server (Browser)

# But this isn't an essential solution

- Time to process does not change
- And attention is paid to the movie, the work itself may be delayed rather than it
  - In Japanese, "本末転倒"

# OK, let's use RStudio's Jobs Pane!

# v1.2(stable) will be comming soon...?

- **This is still under development**
  - There is much possibility that specification of function will be changed
  - Also, the behavior of software (including other features) may be unstable
- Let's try RStudio v1.2!
  - There are lots of convenient things besides the features introduced today
  - Please try and feedback!

# Enjoy!
